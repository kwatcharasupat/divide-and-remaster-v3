# Divide and Remaster v3

Divide and Remaster v3 is a multilingual rework of the Divide and Remaster v2 dataset by PÃ©termann et al. 

The major changes from DnR v2 are as follows:
- the dialogue stem now contains content from more than 30 languages across various language families;
- speech, vocals, and/or vocalizations have been removed from the music and effects stems;
- loudness and timing parametrization have been adjusted to approximate the distributions of real cinematic content;
- the mastering process now preserves relative loudness between stems and approximates standard industry practices.
